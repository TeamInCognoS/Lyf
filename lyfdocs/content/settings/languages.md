## The Lyf Philosophy.
Just as life goes on around the world. The Lyf philosophy believes that you the user, should be able to access the app, wherever you are from. Thus, we are starting to support several languages that are considered to be the most spoken 'round the world.

<br>

## Supported Languages.
We are constantly working towards adding more languages and improving the present `l10n` aka the **localization experience.** Keep a watch at this page as we work to extend support for _more languages._ Below is a list of languages that are currently supported by Lyf:
- English
- Hindi
- Spanish
- French

## Changing languages.
If your language is one of the above supported ones, just chill, you don't need to do nothing. Lyf will provide you the **localization experience** by default. Now, if you're one who's learning other languages and wanna improve your consistency or maybe just wanna goof around, we have your back! Follow the below steps: 
- Just swipe right or click on the the drawer button from the home page. This will open a side drawer, here, click on the settings icon. 
- You will be directed to the settings page, now select languages and then choose one of the supported languages!
